# Random Cat Generator

## Overview
The Random Cat Generator is a simple, fun web application created by Hamaad Asif. It uses TheCatAPI to generate random pictures of cats. This project is a great example of how to integrate external APIs into a web application.

## Features
- **Random Cat Images**: With a single click, users can generate random cat images.
- **Simple and Responsive UI**: The application features a user-friendly interface and is responsive, making it accessible on various devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## API Used
- TheCatAPI (https://thecatapi.com/)

## How It Works
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with the application through a button on the webpage.
2. **Fetching Data**: When the button is clicked, a JavaScript function (`loadCat`) makes a request to TheCatAPI.
3. **Displaying Cats**: The application then displays the cat image returned by the API.
